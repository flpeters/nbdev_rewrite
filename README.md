# nbdev-rewrite
From the ground up rewrite of nbdev (https://github.com/fastai/nbdev) with the goal of more flexibility and reliability.

This is not ready for production by any means, and is mainly used as a playground to test out new ideas. The target for now is to experiment with different technologies, and in the long run, to achieve feature parity, with greatly improved flexibility and reliability.  
Also, this is a personal project / programming exercise.

For the purpose of having to do less work, some components are copied over from the original project.
